----------

This repository contains a text compression and decompression algorithm implemented in Python. The algorithm is based on replacements and involves several scripts to perform different tasks.

## Scripts

Here is a brief description of each script:

1. **escribe_archivo.py:** This script is used to write the input text file.
2. **Leer_archivo.py:** This script is used to read the input text file.
3. **reemplazo.py:** This script performs the replacement operation based on the frequency of words.
4. **tabulacion_cambios.py:** This script creates a table of replacements in a separate file.
5. **leer_tabulacion_cambios.py:** This script reads the table of replacements.
