----------

This repository contains a text compression and decompression algorithm based on replacements. The algorithm works as follows:

1. It takes a text file as input and sets a replacement threshold.
2. For each word whose frequency is equal to or greater than the replacement threshold, it changes its string of characters to another.
3. It adds a table with each of the replacements in a separate file, indicating the original word and its new string.

The algorithm does not modify the input file. Instead, it creates a new file with the same name as the original but with a `.rep` extension for the compressed text and a `.tab` extension for the table of replacements.
